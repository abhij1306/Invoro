Invoro extracts structured data from ecommerce, job, automobile, content, article, forum-thread, and tabular targets. It prefers deterministic evidence first: platform adapters, structured sources, JS state, network payloads, and DOM selectors. LLM calls are optional backfill only.

## Features

| Area                   | What it does                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTTP-first acquisition | Starts with `curl-cffi`, escalates to Patchright/Playwright only when blocking, hydration, or browser-only content requires it.                     |
| Tiered extraction      | Runs `adapter -> structured source -> JS state -> DOM -> confidence scoring -> optional LLM gap fill`.                                              |
| Surface-aware crawling | Supports ecommerce, jobs, automobiles, content pages, article feeds/pages, forum threads, and tabular surfaces.                                     |
| Domain memory          | Stores reusable run profiles, cookie state, learned selectors, acquisition evidence, and field feedback by normalized `(domain, surface)`.          |
| Review workflow        | Lets operators inspect crawl records, artifact HTML, selector candidates, field winners, and promote domain selectors.                              |
| Exports                | Produces JSON, CSV, artifact bundles, and Discoverist-style exports from persisted crawl records.                                                   |
| Product Intelligence   | Discovers matching products, scores candidates, launches candidate crawls, reviews matches, and can create monitors from accepted jobs.             |
| Data enrichment        | Builds ecommerce enrichment jobs from persisted detail records with deterministic taxonomy, attribute, and pricing normalization.                   |
| Product monitors       | Schedules recurring crawl runs, diffs tracked fields, stores snapshots/events, and emits in-app notifications.                                      |
| Agentic Delta alerts   | Adds single-product price/availability alerts with sandboxed conditions, test polling, history, and webhook delivery logs.                          |
| Public API v1          | Exposes API-key authenticated extraction with auto/content/article/forum routing, domain lookup, capabilities, and alert endpoints under `/api/v1`. |
| MCP wrappers           | Provides a hosted FastMCP server for product extraction tools and a stdio alert wrapper over public alert endpoints.                                |
| Orchestration          | Groups projects and workflows around normal crawl runs; current workflow supports competitive pricing snapshots and monitor promotion.              |
| UCP audit              | Runs deterministic UCP compliance audits, stores report artifacts, and exports JSON/Markdown repair roadmaps.                                       |
| Observability          | Uses structured logs, correlation IDs, health checks, Prometheus metrics, run logs, and artifact capture.                                           |

## Architecture

Core runtime flow:

```text
User/API request
  -> Crawl run settings
  -> Acquisition policy
  -> HTTP or browser fetch
  -> Extraction loop
     -> adapters
     -> structured sources
     -> JS state and network payloads
     -> DOM selectors
  -> Confidence scoring
  -> Optional LLM backfill
  -> Persist crawl records
  -> Review, enrichment, monitors, alerts, API, and MCP
```

## Public API and MCP

Create API keys in the UI or through `/api/api-keys`. Public routes use bearer auth:

```powershell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/capabilities
```

Hosted MCP server:

```powershell
cd backend
$env:CRAWLERAI_API_KEY='<api-key>'
$env:CRAWLERAI_API_BASE_URL='http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1'
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.mcp_server.server
```

Alert stdio wrapper:

```powershell
cd backend
$env:CRAWLERAI_API_KEY='<api-key>'
$env:CRAWLERAI_API_BASE_URL='http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1'
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.mcp.alert_server
```

## Development

Backend checks:

```powershell
cd backend
$env:PYTHONPATH='.'
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests -q
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_acquire_smoke.py commerce
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_extraction_smoke.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_test_sites_acceptance.py
```

Frontend checks:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
```

Use the smallest relevant check for local slices. Run broader smoke or acceptance checks when changing shared acquisition, extraction, persistence, monitor, or API behavior.

## Engineering Rules

- Fix extraction defects upstream, not in publishers or exports.
- Keep runtime strings, thresholds, tokens, fields, and tunables in `backend/app/services/config/*`.
- Respect explicit user controls for surface, traversal, proxy, browser, and `llm_enabled`.
- Use LLMs only when both run settings and active config allow them.
- Reuse existing owners before adding new files or abstractions.
