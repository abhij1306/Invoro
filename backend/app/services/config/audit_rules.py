"""Audit rule table: symptom -> violated INVARIANT rule -> owning file.

Config-only (INVARIANT Rule 1). The audit engine in
``app/services/observability/run_audit.py`` imports these and must not inline
rule strings, owner paths, or severities.

Each rule maps a deterministic symptom (computed from the RunTrace, browser.json,
and persisted record) to:
- ``code``: stable flag id
- ``invariant``: the INVARIANT.md rule it violates (for the human/agent reader)
- ``owner``: the owning file from CODEBASE_MAP (where the fix belongs)
- ``severity``: high | medium | low
- ``symptom``: short human description
