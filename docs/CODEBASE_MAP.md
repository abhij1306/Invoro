## Quick Guardrails

- Config belongs in `services/config/*`
- Fix extraction upstream, not in publish or persistence
- Do not create `_helpers.py`, `_utils.py`, or compat stubs
- Do not hardcode platforms in generic paths
- Test public behavior, not private internals

See `docs/ENGINEERING_STRATEGY.md` for the full anti-pattern list.
